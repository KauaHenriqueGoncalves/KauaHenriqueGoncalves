## üêß Hello, Guys!!

I'm Kau√£ Henrique, a Software Engineering student with a degree in Software Development Technician. I'm currently delving deeper into backend technologies, focusing on Java, Spring Boot, and several others, and I've been adding practical projects to my GitHub that reflect my studies and development in the field. My goal is to develop applications, applying best practices, architectural patterns, and automated testing. Here you'll find codes, ideas, and technical experiments that are part of my learning as a developer.

---

Here, I'm just another technology enthusiast. I work on some projects in Python and am currently dedicated to learning more about other tools, always seeking to further expand my programming knowledge. I started in the area because I often felt the need to obtain tools that I couldn't find on the internet, so I decided to create them myself. <br>
My focus as a programmer is problem solving and task automation. I like new challenges and learning new technologies.
